# Documentation Agent Instructions

## Purpose

This directory contains functional documentation, architecture decisions, and design documents for the TicTacToe project.

## Documentation Standards

### Document Types

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Significant architectural decisions
- **Design Documents** - Feature designs and technical specifications
- **API Documentation** - Detailed API endpoint documentation
- **User Guides** - How to use the application

### Writing Guidelines

- Write in clear, concise language
- Use Markdown format for all documentation
- Include diagrams where they add clarity (Mermaid diagrams preferred)
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Date all documents and include version information

### Structure

- Use consistent heading hierarchy
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Add cross-references to related documents
- Use code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting

### Maintenance

- Review and update documentation when related code changes
- Archive outdated documentation rather than deleting it
- Link to relevant code sections when appropriate
- Keep a changelog for significant documentation updates

## Best Practices

- Documentation should explain "why" not just "what"
- Include examples and use cases
- Consider the audience (developers, architects, stakeholders)
- Use diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
- Maintain a glossary for domain-specific terms
