# 13. Licenses, IP, and public matching (workshop essentials)

## Goal
Know the practical settings and behaviors that matter for IP and compliance during Copilot usage.

## Time
10–15 minutes

## What to cover (hands-on, not theory)
1. **Your organization’s policy comes first**
   - Confirm whether Copilot usage is allowed for this repo.

2. **Public code matching / reference features**
   - In Copilot settings (VS Code and/or GitHub account settings), check options related to:
     - suggestions matching public code
     - showing references
   - Instructor note: UI names can vary by plan and date.

3. **License awareness (practical)**
   - If Copilot suggests a large block of code that looks “library-like”, treat it as suspicious.
   - Prefer: ask for a minimal, original implementation or a standard library approach.

## Prompts that encourage safer output
- “Write an original implementation, keep it short, avoid copying known library code.”
- “Use built-in .NET APIs; do not depend on new external packages.”

## Micro exercise
Ask Copilot:
- “Implement a simple string contains search for plane names. Keep it minimal.”
Then discuss:
- Is this generic/common? (Likely fine)
- Is it an unusually long or distinctive snippet? (Be cautious)

## Success criteria
- Participants can name at least 2 guardrails for IP risk.
