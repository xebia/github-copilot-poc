# 00. Course overview (for instructors)

## Audience
Developers using VS Code, with optional GitHub.com demos.

## Learning goals
- Use Copilot in VS Code: completions, next edits, inline chat, chat view
- Use Copilot to explain/debug real C# code
- Understand practical governance: IP/licensing, public matching, responsible use
- Understand context, prompt craft, models, and Premium Requests at a pragmatic level

## Explicitly out of scope (by design)
- Agentic workflow demos
- Plan/Edit mode deep dives
- MCP servers and custom agents
- Review agents, Spaces, Spark, Spec Kit, metrics

## Recommended pacing (2–3 hours)
- Labs 01–04: 30–40 min
- Labs 05–09: 60–90 min
- Labs 10–16: 45–60 min
- Lab 17: 20–30 min

## Instructor setup tips
- Have participants open `code/` as the workspace folder.
- Keep terminal commands ready: `dotnet test`, `dotnet run`.
- Encourage “smallest change” prompts and validation by tests.
- **Variety tip:** Most labs use `PlanesController`. For variety, point participants to `FlightsController` (uses repository pattern) during Lab 11 or 17.
- **Pre-broken test (Lab 09):** Consider preparing a branch with a known failing test for faster setup.
