# 06. Next Edit Suggestions lab - small refactor

## Goal
Use Copilot’s “next edit” style suggestions to make a consistent change across a file.

## Time
15–20 minutes

## Refactor
Make logging and error responses consistent across `PlanesController` actions.

## Pick one focus
1. **Logging consistency**
   - Standardize the log messages in `GetAll`, `GetById`, and `Post`.

2. **Error response consistency**
   - Ensure `NotFound()` and `BadRequest()` responses are used consistently.

## Steps
1. Open `code/WrightBrothersApi/Controllers/PlanesController.cs`.
2. Make one small edit (e.g., adjust the `GetAll` log message).
3. Watch for next-edit style suggestions to apply similar changes in other actions.
4. Accept selectively—don’t accept changes that alter behavior you didn’t intend.

## Prompts to use (if your VS Code shows a “suggest next edit” affordance)
- “Apply the same logging format to the other endpoints in this controller.”
- “Make error responses consistent across these actions.”
## Fallback (if Next Edit Suggestions aren't available)
If you don't see Next Edit Suggestions:
1. Select the method you just edited.
2. Open Inline Chat (`Ctrl+I`).
3. Ask: "Apply the same logging format to the other action methods in this file."
## Success criteria
- Consistent style across multiple methods
- No unintended behavior changes

## Instructor note
This is a great moment to emphasize: Copilot is fast, but you remain responsible for correctness.
