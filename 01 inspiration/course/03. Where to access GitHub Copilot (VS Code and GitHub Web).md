# 03. Where to access GitHub Copilot (VS Code and GitHub Web)

## Goal
Know the *three* most useful entry points for Copilot during a workshop.

## Time
5–10 minutes

## In VS Code
- **Inline suggestions (ghost text)** while typing
  - Accept with `Tab`, dismiss with `Esc`, cycle with `Alt+]` / `Alt+[`
- **Inline Chat** (ask about the code you're looking at, right where you edit)
  - Open with `Ctrl+I` (or select code → right-click → Copilot → Start Inline Chat)
- **Chat view** (longer questions, multi-step changes, debugging help)
  - Open with `Ctrl+Alt+I` or click the Chat icon in the Activity Bar

## Features overview (what we’ll demo)
- Code completions
- Next edit suggestions (a.k.a. multi-location edits from a single change)
- Inline Chat
- Chat view (Ask-style help)
- Debugging help (reason about failing tests, errors)
- Workspace-aware prompts with `@workspace` (standard in current Copilot builds)
- Slash commands: `/explain`, `/fix`, `/tests`, `/doc`, `/new`

### Mini exercise
1. Open `code/WrightBrothersApi/Controllers/PlanesController.cs`.
2. Try each entry point:
   - Type a few lines and accept/ignore a completion.
   - Use Inline Chat on a selected method.
   - Ask in Chat view: “Summarize what this controller does.”

## On GitHub.com
Common places you can use Copilot on the web (depending on org/plan/feature availability):
- **Copilot Chat on GitHub** to ask questions about a repo
- **Pull request assistance** (summaries, explanations)
- **Docs/Markdown help** (including Mermaid diagrams)

### Mini exercise
1. Open this repo in a browser on GitHub: https://github.com
2. Navigate to a C# file (e.g., `code/WrightBrothersApi/Controllers/PlanesController.cs`).
3. Use Copilot (if available in your UI) to ask: “Explain this file for a new team member.”

## Success criteria
- You can demonstrate Copilot in VS Code and name at least one GitHub Web scenario.
