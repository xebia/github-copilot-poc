# 10. Context lab - get better answers by feeding better context

## Goal
See how context changes Copilot’s output quality, and learn a simple “context checklist”.

## Time
10–15 minutes

## The context checklist (practical)
Before asking:
- Open the relevant files
- Select the relevant code
- Include the exact error message / stack trace
- State constraints: framework, style, “don’t change behavior”, “use existing libs”

## Exercise: same question, 3 ways
### 1) No context (worse)
Ask: “Why is my test failing?”

**Typical response:** Generic advice about common test failures, no specific fix.

### 2) Minimal context (better)
Ask: "This xUnit test fails. Here is the error output: … What's the cause?"

**Typical response:** Identifies the assertion failure, may guess at the cause.

### 3) Rich context (best)
- Open the failing test file and the code it tests.
- Ask: "Given this test and this controller method, explain why it fails and propose the smallest fix. Keep FluentAssertions."

**Typical response:** Points to the exact line, explains mismatch, proposes minimal code change.

## Success criteria
- You can articulate which details improved the answer.

## Instructor note
This lab ties directly to responsible use: better context reduces hallucinations and improves correctness.
