# 16. Responsible use, limitations, and security FAQs (practical)

## Goal
Build safe habits: verify outputs, avoid secrets, and understand what Copilot can’t reliably do.

## Time
10–15 minutes

## Practical limitations to demonstrate
- Copilot can be confidently wrong (hallucinated APIs, nonexistent files)
- It may miss edge cases (nulls, validation, status codes)
- It can propose insecure patterns if prompted poorly

## Security habits (hands-on)
1. **Never paste secrets** into chat
   - API keys, tokens, connection strings, customer data
2. **Ask for secure defaults**
   - “Use parameter validation and return appropriate status codes.”
   - “Avoid logging sensitive data.”
3. **Verify with tests/build**
   - `dotnet test` is your friend.

## Micro exercises
- Ask: “Review this controller for security issues and suggest improvements without adding new dependencies.”
- Ask: “Does CORS policy look safe for production? Explain tradeoffs.”

## Security FAQ (talking points)
- Copilot suggestions are not automatically “safe” or “licensed for your use” by default—treat them like code from the internet.
- Always review, test, and align with your org policies.

## Success criteria
- Participants can name 3 safe-use rules.
- Participants can show one example of verifying Copilot output (build/test).
