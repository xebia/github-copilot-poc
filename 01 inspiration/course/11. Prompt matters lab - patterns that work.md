# 11. Prompt matters lab - patterns that work

## Goal
Practice prompt patterns that consistently yield high-quality, safe edits.

## Time
15–20 minutes

## Prompt patterns to practice
1. **Role + task + constraints**
   - “You are a senior C# dev. Add an endpoint. Keep behavior unchanged for existing endpoints. Use clear naming.”

2. **Smallest change first**
   - “What is the smallest change to add X?”

3. **Ask for options**
   - “Give 2 approaches, list tradeoffs, then recommend one.”

4. **Force grounding**
   - “Only reference files that exist in this workspace.”

5. **Request verification steps**
   - “After proposing the change, tell me how to validate with `dotnet test`.”

## Hands-on prompts (use this repo)
- “Add a `GET /planes/{id}` test. Use the existing patterns. If you need data setup, use the existing `setup` endpoint or propose a test-only approach.”
- “Explain what the health check does and how to test it locally.”
- "In `FlightsController`, explain how `IFlightRepository` is used. What pattern is this?" (demonstrates repository pattern awareness)
## Anti-patterns to avoid
- “Just make it better” (too vague)
- “Rewrite the whole project” (too big)

## Success criteria
- You can produce a focused change request and get a focused response.
