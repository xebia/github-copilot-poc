# 02. How to enable GitHub Copilot in VS Code

## Goal
Enable Copilot in VS Code, sign in, and verify it’s providing suggestions and chat.

## Time
10–15 minutes

## Prerequisites
- VS Code installed
- GitHub account with Copilot access (trial or paid)
- Network access to GitHub

## Steps
1. **Install the extension** (VS Code Extensions view)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot" and install it.
   - If you see a separate "GitHub Copilot Chat" extension, install that as well.

   **Short explainer: why you may see two extensions**
   When you install Copilot in VS Code, you may end up with two related extensions:
   - **GitHub Copilot** — inline coding suggestions (ghost text) as you type
   - **GitHub Copilot Chat** — conversational AI (Chat view + Inline Chat)

   Depending on your VS Code version and rollout state, Copilot features may be unified into a single extension or split. For this workshop: install **GitHub Copilot**, and if Chat UI/features don’t show up, also install **GitHub Copilot Chat**.

2. **Sign in and set up Copilot**
   - Use the Accounts menu in VS Code (bottom-left) to sign in to GitHub.
   - Or click the Copilot icon in the Status Bar and choose **Set up Copilot**.
   - Confirm you’re signed in with the account that has Copilot enabled.

3. **Verify Copilot is on**
   - Look for Copilot status in the VS Code Status Bar.
   - If disabled, enable it for this workspace.

4. **Verify code suggestions**
   - Open `code/WrightBrothersApi/Controllers/PlanesController.cs`.
   - Add a new method stub (e.g., type `private` then pause) and wait for a suggestion.

5. **Verify chat**
   - Open the Chat view.
   - Ask: “What endpoints exist in PlanesController?”

## Troubleshooting
- If Chat is missing: open Command Palette → search for “Chat” / “Copilot”.
- If completions don’t appear: check Copilot is enabled for the language (C#) and workspace.
- If sign-in loops: sign out/in and restart VS Code.

## Success criteria
- You see at least one ghost-text suggestion.
- Copilot Chat answers questions about an open file.
