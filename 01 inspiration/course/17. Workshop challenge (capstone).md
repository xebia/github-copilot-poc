# 17. Workshop challenge (capstone)

## Goal
Put the basics together in a small, realistic change.

## Time
20–30 minutes

## Challenge
Add a small feature + tests, using Copilot tools appropriately.

### Pick one (depending on what you've already done)
- **Option A:** `GET /planes/search?year=...` (if you haven't done Lab 05)
- **Option B:** `DELETE /planes/{id}` → removes a plane from the in-memory list
- **Option C:** `PUT /planes/{id}` → updates an existing plane's properties

### Requirements
1. Add the endpoint
2. Add/adjust tests
3. Run tests
4. Use Chat to explain your change

## Constraints
- Keep changes minimal and readable
- Don’t add new packages
- Prefer consistent error handling

## Suggested workflow
- Use **code completions** for the initial method stub
- Use **Inline Chat** to refine one method or add a test
- Use **Chat view** to explain failures and propose fixes

## Prompts
- “Write the smallest possible endpoint and two unit tests.”
- “Now explain the change like a PR description (what/why/how tested).”

## Success criteria
- `dotnet test` passes
- You can summarize the change as a short PR description (what you changed, why, how you tested it)
