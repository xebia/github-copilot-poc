# 01. What is GitHub Copilot?

## Goal
Understand what GitHub Copilot is, the full spectrum of what it can do, and why it's transforming how developers work.

## Time
5–10 minutes

## What is Copilot?
GitHub Copilot is an **AI-powered development platform** that goes far beyond simple code completion. It's an ecosystem of AI capabilities that can assist with everything from writing a single line of code to autonomously implementing entire features.

Think of it as a spectrum:

```
Simple ◀━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━▶ Powerful

Code          Inline        Chat         Agent        Autonomous
Completions → Chat      →   View     →   Mode     →   Agents
(ghost text)  (quick edits) (conversations) (multi-file) (fully autonomous)
```

## The full power of Copilot

### 🔹 Code Completions
Type and Copilot suggests the next lines. Fast, seamless, always there.

### 🔹 Inline Chat
Select code, ask a question or request a change, get it done right there.

### 🔹 Chat View
Have longer conversations. Debug issues. Explore architecture decisions. Generate documentation.

### 🔹 Agent Mode
This is where it gets powerful. Agent mode can:
- Autonomously edit multiple files to implement a feature
- Run terminal commands to test its own changes
- Iterate on errors until the code works
- Create entire project structures from a description

### 🔹 GitHub Copilot coding agent
Assign an issue to the Copilot coding agent and it works **autonomously in the background**:
- Creates a branch
- Implements the feature across multiple files
- Runs tests
- Opens a pull request for your review
- You review and merge—or send it back for changes

### 🔹 GitHub Code Review Agent
Copilot reviews pull requests like a team member:
- Analyzes code for bugs, security issues, and style
- Leaves inline comments with suggestions
- Can be configured with your team's standards

### 🔹 Custom Agents & MCP Servers
Build your own specialized agents:
- Connect to internal APIs, databases, documentation
- Create domain-specific assistants (e.g., "query our analytics platform")
- Extend Copilot with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

### 🔹 GitHub Spark
Describe an app in natural language → get a working micro-app. No deployment hassles. Prototype ideas in minutes.

### 🔹 Copilot Spaces
Persistent, shareable AI workspaces with curated context. Great for onboarding or complex projects.

## Why this matters
| Traditional workflow | With Copilot |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Write every line yourself | Copilot suggests, you steer |
| Context-switch to docs/Stack Overflow | Ask Copilot in your editor |
| Manual code review | AI-assisted review catches issues |
| Assign task → dev implements → PR → review | Assign task → Copilot implements → you review |
| Days to prototype | Minutes with Spark |

## What Copilot is NOT
- ❌ A replacement for understanding your code
- ❌ Always correct (you must review and test)
- ❌ A security auditor (it can suggest insecure patterns)
- ❌ Magic—it works best when you provide good context and clear intent

## But first: let's start simple

This course focuses on the **foundational skills** you need before unlocking the advanced capabilities:

| This course covers | Out of scope (for now) |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Code completions | Agentic workflows |
| Inline Chat | Custom agents |
| Chat view (Ask mode) | MCP servers |
| Debugging with Copilot | GitHub Copilot coding agent |
| Context & prompt craft | GitHub Copilot code review |
| Responsible use | GitHub Spark |

**Why?** Because the advanced features build on these fundamentals. Master context, prompts, and the feedback loop first—then the agentic features become much more powerful.

## Next step
In **Lab 02**, we'll enable Copilot in VS Code and verify it's working. Then we'll progressively build your skills through hands-on exercises with a real C# API.

## Success criteria
- You can describe the spectrum of Copilot capabilities (from completions to autonomous agents)
- You understand why we're starting with the basics
- You're excited to try it out!

## Notes for the instructor (talk track)
- Show the "art of the possible" to build excitement
- Make it clear: this course is about building the foundation
- The skills learned here (context, prompts, verification) apply to ALL Copilot features
