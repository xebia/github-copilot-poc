# 08. Copilot Chat lab - Ask mode basics

## Goal
Use Copilot Chat effectively for "Ask" style help—explanations, suggestions, and safe edits.

## Time
10–15 minutes

## Key idea
**Ask mode** is great for: explanations, quick suggestions, small code snippets, debugging hypotheses, and targeted edits.

## Hands-on (Ask)
In Chat view, try these:
- “Explain why `public partial class Program { }` exists in `Program.cs`.”
- “What does the health check in `Program.cs` do? What env var does it use?”
- “Suggest a better name for the in-memory planes list field and why.”

## Hands-on (apply edits carefully)
- Ask: “Add XML comments to the public controller actions in `PlanesController`. Follow our conventions.”
- If Copilot proposes multi-file changes, constrain it:
  - “Only change `PlanesController.cs`. Keep behavior identical.”

## Success criteria
- You can demonstrate 2–3 high-signal questions and apply one safe edit.

## Instructor note
Keep focus on Ask mode. Agent/automation workflows are out of scope for this course.
