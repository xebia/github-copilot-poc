# 04. First prompt with @workspace - understand the project

## Goal
Use Copilot Chat with workspace context to quickly understand the solution structure and how it runs.

## Time
10–15 minutes

## Why this matters
The fastest way to get value is to ask Copilot questions that require **repo-wide context**.

## Steps (VS Code)
1. Open the folder `code/` in VS Code.
2. Open Chat view (`Ctrl+Alt+I`).
3. Use `@workspace` to give Copilot repo-wide context.

## Prompts to try
- “@workspace Describe the solution structure (projects, controllers, repositories, tests).”
- “@workspace What are the API endpoints and which controller exposes them?”
- “@workspace How do I run the API and run tests from the command line?”
- “@workspace Where is the in-memory plane list stored, and what would be needed to persist it?”

## Follow-up prompts (to demonstrate iterative refinement)
- “Only mention files that exist in this repo.”
- “Give me the 3 most important files to read first and why.”

## Success criteria
- You get a clear, accurate file list and run commands (`dotnet run`, `dotnet test`).

## Instructor note
If the model hallucinates paths, immediately demonstrate: “Show me the exact file path(s) you’re referring to.”
