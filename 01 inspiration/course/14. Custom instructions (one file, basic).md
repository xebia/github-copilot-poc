# 14. Custom instructions (one file, basic)

## Goal
Use a single, general instruction file to steer Copilot toward your team conventions—without deep customization.

## Time
10–15 minutes

## What exists in this repo
There is a general instructions file at the root:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (relative to the repository root)

In this sample repo, that file is already present. If you're adapting this workshop to a different project and the file doesn't exist yet, create it with basic team conventions (async/await, DI, xUnit tests, XML docs).

## Hands-on
1. Open `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
2. In Chat, ask:
   - “Based on our Copilot instructions, what conventions should new C# endpoints follow?”
3. Then ask Copilot to propose a tiny change:
   - “Add XML comments to the public API actions in `PlanesController`. Follow our instructions.”

## Keep it intentionally basic
- One file, general rules.
- No prompt libraries, no custom agents, no complex instruction hierarchies.

## Success criteria
- Copilot output aligns better with your conventions (async/await, DI, tests, XML docs).
