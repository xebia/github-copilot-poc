For the Wright Brothers API, we use modern C# features, async/await for all asynchronous code, and write unit tests with xUnit. We manage resources with using, handle errors with try/catch, and prefer clear, focused methods with dependency injection. All code should use our standard conventions—safe null handling, properties instead of public fields, and XML comments for public APIs.
